# CampoMinado-com-recursividade
The minesweeper game with ranking and recursivity.

This code is for a minesweeper game that has a score and ranking system. It was developed as an evaluation activity for the subject of "Programming Fundamentals", given by the professor Melise on the first semester of 2020.

It is also implemented as an extra, the recursive function to open zero tiles and their surrounding, resulting in a much cleaner and better-looking game.
